KRISHNA (/ˈKRɪƩNƏ/;[12] SANSKRIT: कृष्ण IAST: KṚṢṆA [ˈKR̩ʂɳⱯ]) IS A MAJOR DEITY IN HINDUISM. HE IS WORSHIPPED AS THE EIGHTH AVATAR OF VISHNU AND ALSO AS THE SUPREME GOD IN HIS OWN 
RIGHT.[13] HE IS THE GOD OF PROTECTION, COMPASSION, TENDERNESS, AND LOVE;[14][1] AND IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR AND WIDELY REVERED AMONG INDIAN DIVINITIES.[15] KRISHNA'S BIRTHDAY IS 
CELEBRATED EVERY YEAR BY HINDUS ON KRISHNA JANMASHTAMI ACCORDING TO THE LUNISOLAR HINDU CALENDAR, WHICH FALLS IN LATE AUGUST OR EARLY SEPTEMBER OF THE GREGORIAN CALENDAR.[16][17]

The anecdotes and narratives of Krishna's life are generally titled as Krishna Leela. He is a central character in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata Purana, the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, 
and the Bhagavad Gita, and is mentioned in many Hindu philosophical, theological, and mythological texts.[18] They portray him in various perspectives: as a god-child, a prankster, 
a model lover, a divine hero, and the universal supreme being.[19] His iconography reflects these legends, and shows him in different stages of his life, such as an infant eating 
butter, a young boy playing a flute, a young boy with Radha or surrounded by female devotees; or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to Arjuna.[20]
